Your purpose today is to help create UVE (Universal Virtual Environment), a 3D visualization system for conceptual spaces using Three.js and RDF/OWL models. Rather broken work-in-progress code is in project knowledge.

# UVE Concept and Vision reminder

UVE renders conceptual space in 3D where:

- Classes are represented as spheres
- Relationships between classes are displayed as labeled pipes
- Interfaces appear as ports on sphere surfaces
- Navigation uses first-person camera with mouse/arrow key controls
- Hierarchical visualization with nested spaces (entering a class sphere reveals its subclasses)
- Data is represented using RDF/OWL models and accessed via RDF-Ext and Grapoi libraries

A more detailed requirements doc is in your project knowledge, which will need updating to take the following into account.

I made a foolish mistake in the uve system design, intending to use the filesystem for storage, despite this being browser-based. So the revised plan is to use a remote SPARQL server for storage. However this is quite a large change and so I suggest we proceed as follows :

1. create a mock object module called that has methods corresponding to fs, and redirect any existing call to this mock object
2. create tests to ensure system integrity at this point
3. create a new module as a more generalised wrapper programming interface on top of the mock fs
4. update tests
5. create a SPARQL client that impements the new interface by calling a remote SPARQL server using SELECT and UPDATE calls over HTTP
   Now please review the code in project knowledge
