# UVE Project Handover Document

## Project Overview

UVE (Universal Virtual Environment) is a 3D visualization system for conceptual spaces using Three.js for rendering and RDF/OWL models for data representation. The system visualizes classes as spheres, relationships as pipes, and interfaces as ports on sphere surfaces, allowing users to navigate through a 3D representation of interconnected concepts.

## Current State

We've successfully implemented the core architecture and components of the UVE system following a Model-View design with a pub-sub messaging system. The application is structured to support different storage backends (filesystem-based and SPARQL-based) and provides a flexible way to model and visualize RDF data.

### Implemented Features

- ✅ Core architecture with Model-View separation
- ✅ Event-based communication between components
- ✅ Storage abstraction layer with multiple backends
  - ✅ Mock filesystem for browser storage
  - ✅ SPARQL client for remote storage
- ✅ RDF data model using RDF-Ext
- ✅ Conceptual model transforming RDF data into domain entities
- ✅ Basic Three.js visualization setup
- ✅ RDF file editing view
- ✅ FOAF example implementation

### Outstanding Issues

1. **Relationship Rendering**: The system is having difficulty connecting relationships between class instances in the 3D visualization. While classes are being loaded into the model, the connective "pipes" are not appearing correctly.

2. **URI Matching**: There are mismatches between how URIs are represented in the RDF data versus how they're stored in the visualization component maps. We've implemented a `findSphereByUri` method to help with this, but it's not fully resolving the issue.

3. **Class Instance Detection**: RDF instances of classes need better detection and processing. We've implemented class instance loading, but it may need further refinement.

4. **Debug Visualization**: Currently, only the red debug sphere is visible in the Three.js view, indicating that while Three.js is initializing correctly, the actual model elements aren't being properly rendered.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Core Layer**
   - `eventBus.js`: Pub-sub messaging for loose coupling between components
   - `config.js`: System-wide configuration

2. **Model Layer**
   - `rdfModel.js`: Manages RDF datasets using RDF-Ext and Grapoi
   - `conceptModel.js`: Transforms RDF data into domain entities
   - Entity types: `classEntity.js`, `relationshipEntity.js`, `interfaceEntity.js`

3. **View Layer**
   - `threeView.js`: 3D visualization using Three.js
   - `rdfFileView.js`: UI for editing RDF data

4. **Storage Layer**
   - `storageService.js`: Abstract interface for storage
   - `fsStorageService.js`: Filesystem implementation
   - `sparqlStorageService.js`: SPARQL endpoint implementation
   - `storageManager.js`: Unified access point for storage operations

5. **Examples**
   - `foafExample.js`: Friend-of-a-friend example data

### Data Flow

1. RDF data is loaded from storage into the RDF model
2. The concept model transforms this data into domain entities
3. The Three.js view renders these entities in 3D
4. User interactions trigger events that are processed by appropriate handlers
5. Changes are propagated back to the model and persisted in storage

## Next Steps

Based on the specification document and current state, here are the recommended next steps:

### 1. Fix Relationship Rendering

- Debug the relationship rendering pipeline in `threeView.js`
- Ensure class instances (e.g., FOAF people) are correctly recognized and rendered
- Fix URI matching between RDF data and visualization components

### 2. Complete Interaction Features

- Implement enter/exit functionality for class spheres
- Improve selection and highlighting of objects
- Add information panel for selected objects

### 3. Enhance RDF Model Support

- Improve support for custom vocabularies beyond FOAF
- Add more complete handling of RDF properties and relationships
- Enhance property panel in RDF view

### 4. Implement Advanced Navigation

- Refine the first-person camera controls
- Add collision detection with spheres
- Implement smooth transitions when entering/exiting spheres

### 5. Optimize Performance

- Implement level-of-detail for complex models
- Add object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Optimize RDF queries and transformations

### 6. Enhance Visual Appearance

- Improve sphere, pipe, and port materials and textures
- Add visual effects (glow, highlights, etc.)
- Implement better labels and information displays

### 7. Complete Documentation

- Finalize API documentation
- Create user guide
- Develop examples beyond FOAF

## Conclusion

The UVE project has a solid foundation with the core architecture in place. The main challenge now is fixing the relationship rendering to correctly visualize the connections between entities. Once this is resolved, the focus can shift to enhancing the interaction experience, visual appearance, and performance optimizations.

The modular architecture should make it straightforward to extend the system with new features while maintaining separation of concerns between the model, view, and storage layers.
