The rendering appears exactly the same as it did in the previous screenshot. We now have to stop for the day. It may be a little while before we get back to this, so could you please create a handover document describing the current state of the code. Refer to the specification document in project knowledge to determine next steps. Render this handover document as a complete markdown artifact. Also create one or more mermaid artifacts showing the architecture.
